.SH NAME
iverilog-vpi - Compile front end for VPI modules

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iverilog-vpi
[options]
\fIsourcefile\fP...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIiverilog\-vpi\fP is a tool to simplify the compilation of VPI
modules for use with Icarus Verilog. It takes on the command line a
list of C or C++ source files, and generates as output a linked VPI
module. See the \fBvvp\fP(1) man page for a description of how the
linked module is loaded by a simulation.

By default the output is named after the first source file. For
example, if the first source file is named \fIfoo.c\fP, the output
becomes \fIfoo.vpi\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIiverilog\-vpi\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B -l\fIlibrary\fP
Include the named library in the link of the VPI module. This allows
VPI modules to further reference external libraries.

.TP 8
.B -L\fIdirectory\fP
Add \fIdirectory\fP to the list of directories that will be searched
for library files.

.TP 8
.B -I\fIdirectory\fP
Add \fIdirectory\fP to the list of directories that will be searched
for header files.

.TP 8
.B -D\fIdefine\fP
Define a macro named \fIdefine\fP.

.TP 8
.B --name=\fIname\fP
Normally, the output VPI module will be named after the first source
file passed to the command. This flag sets the name (without the .vpi
suffix) of the output vpi module.

.SH "PC-ONLY OPTIONS"

When built as a native Windows program (using the MinGW toolchain),
by default \fIiverilog\-vpi\fP will attempt to locate the MinGW tools
needed to compile a VPI module on the system path (as set by the PATH
environment variable). As an alternative, the user may specify the
location of the MinGW tools via the following option.

.TP 8
.B -mingw=\fIpath\fP
Tell the program the root of the MinGW compiler tool suite. The
\fBvvp\fP runtime is compiled with this compiler, and this is the
compiler that \fIiverilog\-vpi\fP expects to use to compile your
source code. If this option accompanies a list of files, it will
apply to the current build only. If this option is provided on its
own, \fIiverilog\-vpi\fP will save the \fIpath\fP in the registry
and use that path in preference to the system path for subsequent
operations, avoiding the need to specify it on the command line
every time.

.SH "INFORMATIONAL OPTIONS"

\fIiverilog\-vpi\fP includes additional flags to let Makefile gurus
peek at the configuration of the \fIiverilog\fP installation.  This way,
Makefiles can be written that handle complex VPI builds natively, and
without hard-coding values that depend on the system and installation.
If used at all, these options must be used one at a time, and without
any other options or directives.

.TP 8
.B --install-dir
Print the install directory for VPI modules.

.TP 8
.B --cflags
Print the compiler flags (CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS) needed to compile source
code destined for a VPI module.

.TP 8
.B --ldflags
Print the linker flags (LDFLAGS) needed to link a VPI module.

.TP 8
.B --ldlibs
Print the libraries (LDLIBS) needed to link a VPI module.

.P
Example GNU makefile that takes advantage of these flags:
.IP "" 4
CFLAGS = \-Wall \-O $(CFLAGS_$@)
.br
VPI_CFLAGS := $(shell iverilog-vpi \-\-cflags)
.br
CFLAGS_messagev.o = $(VPI_CFLAGS)
.br
CFLAGS_fifo.o = $(VPI_CFLAGS)
.br
messagev.o fifo.o: transport.h
.br
messagev.vpi: messagev.o fifo.o
.br
