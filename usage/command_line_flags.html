<h1>iverilog Command Line Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#iverilog-command-line-flags" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The iverilog command is the compiler/driver that takes the Verilog input and
generates the output format, whether the simulation file or synthesis
results. This information is at least summarized in the iverilog man page
distributed in typical installations, but here we try to include more detail.</p>
<section id="general">
<h2>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>These flags affect the general behavior of the compiler.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-c &lt;cmdfile&gt;</p>
<p>This flag selects the command file to use. The command file is an
alternative to writing a long command line with a lot of file names and
compiler flags. See the Command File Format page for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-d &lt;flag&gt;</p>
<p>Enable compiler debug output. These are aids for debugging Icarus Verilog,
and this flag is not commonly used.
The flag is one of these debug classes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>scope</p></li>
<li><p>eval_tree</p></li>
<li><p>elaborate</p></li>
<li><p>synth2</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>-g &lt;generation flag&gt;
the generation is the compiler language, and specifies the language and
extensions to use during the compile. The language level can be selected
by a major level selector, and by controlling various features. Various
“-g” flags can be compined. For example, to get Verilog 2001 without
specify supoprt, use “-g2001 -gno-specify”.</p>
<p>The supported flags are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1995</p>
<p>This flag enables the IEEE1364-1995 standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2001</p>
<p>This flag enables the IEEE1364-2001 standard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2001-noconfig</p>
<p>This flag enables the IEEE1364-2001 standard with config file support
disabled. This eliminates the config file keywords from the language and
so helps some programs written to older 2001 support compile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2005
This flag enables the IEEE1364-2005 standard. This is default enabled
after v0.9.</p></li>
<li><p>2009
This flag enables the IEEE1800-2009 standard, which includes
SystemVerilog. The SystemVerilog support is not present in v0.9 and
earlier. It is new to git master as of November 2009. Actual SystemVerilog
support is ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p>2012</p>
<p>This flag enables the IEEE1800-2012 standard, which includes
SystemVerilog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>verilog-ams</p>
<p>This flag enables Verilog-AMS features that are supported by Icarus
Verilog. (This is new as of 5 May 2008.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>assertions/supported-assertions/no-assertions</p>
<p>Enable or disable SystemVerilog assertions. When enabled, assertion
statements are elaborated. When disabled, assertion statements are parsed
but ignored. The supported-assertions option only enables assertions that
are currently supported by the compiler.</p>
</li>
<li><p>specify/no-specify</p>
<p>Enable or disable support for specify block timing controls. When
disabled, specify blocks are parsed but ignored. When enabled, specify
blocks cause timing path and timing checks to be active.</p>
</li>
<li><p>std-include/no-std-include</p>
<p>Enable or disable the search of a standard installation include directory
after all other explicit include directories. This standard include
directory is a convenient place to install standard header files that a
Verilog program may include.</p>
</li>
<li><p>relative-include/no-relative-include</p>
<p>Enable or disable adding the local files directory to the beginning of the
include file search path. This allows files to be included relative to the
current file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>xtypes/no-xtypes</p>
<p>Enable or disable support for extended types. Enabling types allows for
new types and type syntax that are Icarus Verilog extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>io-range-error/no-io-range-error</p>
<p>When enabled the range for a port and any associated net declaration must
match exactly. When disabled a scalar port is allowed to have a net
declaration with a range (obsolete usage). A warning message will be
printed for this combination. All other permutations are still considered
an error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>strict-ca-eval/no-strict-ca-eval</p>
<p>The standard requires that if any input to a continuous assignment
expression changes value, the entire expression is re-evaluated. By
default, parts of the expression that do not depend on the changed input
value(s) are not re-evaluated. If an expression contains a call to a
function that doesn’t depend solely on its input values or that has side
effects, the resulting behavior will differ from that required by the
standard. Enabling strict-ca-eval will force standard compliant behavior
(with some loss in performance).</p>
</li>
<li><p>strict-expr-width/no-strict-expr-width</p>
<p>Enable or disable strict compliance with the standard rules for
determining expression bit lengths. When disabled, the RHS of a parameter
assignment is evaluated as a lossless expression, as is any expression
containing an unsized constant number, and unsized constant numbers are
not truncated to integer width.</p>
</li>
<li><p>shared-loop-index/no-shared-loop-index</p>
<p>Enable or disable the exclusion of for-loop control variables from
implicit event_expression lists. When enabled, if a for-loop control
variable (loop index) is only used inside the for-loop statement, the
compiler will not include it in an implicit event_expression list it
calculates for that statement or any enclosing statement. This allows the
same control variable to be used in multiple processes without risk of
entering an infinite loop caused by each process triggering all other
processes that use the same variable. For strict compliance with the
standards, this behaviour should be disabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>-i</p>
<p>Ignore missing modules. Normally it is an error if a module instantiation
refers to an undefined module. This option causes the compiler to skip over
that instantiation. It will also stop the compiler returning an error if
there are no top level modules. This allows the compiler to be used to check
incomplete designs for errors.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “-i” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-L &lt;path&gt;</p>
<p>Add the specified directory to the path list used to locate VPI modules. The
default path includes only the install directory for the system.vpi module,
but this flag can add other directories. Multiple paths are allowed, and the
paths will be searched in order.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “-L” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-l &lt;path&gt;</p>
<p>Add the specified file to the list of source files to be compiled, but mark
it as a library file. All modules contained within that file will be treated
as library modules, and only elaborated if they are instantiated by other
modules in the design.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “-l” flag is new as of 2 October 2016. It will become available in
releases and snapshots made after that date.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-M&lt;mode&gt;=&lt;path&gt;</p>
<p>Write into the file specified by path a list of files that contribute to the
compilation of the design.</p>
<p>If _mode_ is <em>all</em> or <em>prefix</em>, this includes files that are included by
include directives and files that are automatically loaded by library
support as well as the files explicitly specified by the user.</p>
<p>If _mode_ is <em>include</em>, only files that are included by include directives
are listed.</p>
<p>If _mode_ is <em>module</em>, only files that are specified by the user or that are
automatically loaded by library support are listed. The output is one file
name per line, with no leading or trailing space.</p>
<p>If _mode_ is <em>prefix</em>, files that are included by include directives are
prefixed by “I “ and other files are prefixed by “M “.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-m&lt;module&gt;</p>
<p>Add this module to the list of VPI modules to be loaded by the
simulation. Many modules can be specified, and all will be loaded, in the
order specified. The system module is implicit and always included (and
loaded last).</p>
<p>If the specified name includes at least one directory character, it is
assumed to be prefixed by the path to the module, otherwise the module is
searched for in the paths specified by preceding -L options, and if not
found there, in the iverilog base directory.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “-m” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-o &lt;path&gt;</p>
<p>Specify the output file. The &lt;path&gt; is the name of the file to hold the
output. The default is “a.out”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-S</p>
<p>Activate synthesis. This flag tells the compiler to do what synthesis it can
do before calling the code generator. This flag is rarely used explicitly,
and certain code generators will implicitly enable this flag.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-u</p>
<p>Treat each source file as a separate compilation unit (as defined in
SystemVerilog). If compiling for an IEEE1364 generation, this will just
reset all compiler directives (including macro definitions) before each new
file is processed.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “-u” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-v</p>
<p>Be verbose. Print copyright information, progress messages, and some timing
information about various compilation phases.</p>
<p>(New in snapshots after 2014-12-16) If the selected target is vvp, the -v
switch is appended to the shebang line in the compiler output file, so
directly executing the compiler output file will turn on verbose messages in
vvp. This extra verbosity can be avoided by using the vvp command to
indirectly execute the compiler output file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-V</p>
<p>Print the version information. This skips all compilation. Just print the
version information, including version details for the various components of
the compiler.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-R</p>
<p>Print the runtime paths of the compiler. This can be useful to find, e.g.,
the include path of vpi_user.h.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-W&lt;warning class&gt;</p>
<p>Enable/disable warnings. All the warning types (other then “all”) can be
prefixed with no- to disable that warning.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>all</p>
<p>This enables almost all of the available warnings. More specifically, it
enables these warnings:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-Wanachronisms
-Wimplicit
-Wimplicit-dimensions
-Wmacro-replacement
-Wportbind
-Wselect-range
-Wtimescale
-Wsensitivity-entire-array
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>anachronisms</p>
<p>This enables warnings for use of features that have been deprecated or
removed in the selected generation of the Verilog language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>implicit</p>
<p>This enables warnings for creation of implicit declarations. For example,
if a scalar wire X is used but not declared in the Verilog source, this
will print a warning at its first use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>implicit-dimensions</p>
<p>This enables warnings for the case where a port declaration or a var/net
declaration for the same name is missing dimensions. Normally, Verilog
allows you to do this (the undecorated declaration gets its dimensions
form the decorated declaration) but this is no longer common, and some
other tools (notable Xilix synthesizers) do not handle this correctly.</p>
<p>This flag is supported in release 10.1 or master branch snapshots after
2016-02-06.</p>
</li>
<li><p>macro-redefinition</p>
<p>This enables warnings when a macro is redefined, even if the macro text
remains the same.</p>
<p>NOTE: The “macro-redefinition” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>macro-replacement</p>
<p>This enables warnings when a macro is redefined and the macro text
changes. Use no-macro-redefinition to disable this,</p>
<p>NOTE: The “macro-replacement” flag was added in v11.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>portbind</p>
<p>This enables warnings for ports of module instantiations that are not
connected properly, but probably should be. Dangling input ports, for
example, will generate a warning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>select-range</p>
<p>This enables warnings for constant out-of-bound selects. This includes
partial or fully out-of-bound select as well as a select containing a ‘bx
or ‘bz in the index.</p>
</li>
<li><p>timescale</p>
<p>This enables warnings for inconsistent use of the timescale directive. It
detects if some modules have no timescale, or if modules inherit timescale
from another file. Both probably mean that timescales are inconsistent,
and simulation timing can be confusing and dependent on compilation order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>infloop</p>
<p>This enables warnings for always statements that may have runtime infinite
loops (i.e. has paths with zero or no delay). This class of warnings is
not included in -Wall and hence does not have a no- variant. A fatal error
message will always be printed when the compiler can determine that there
will definitely be an infinite loop (all paths have no or zero delay).</p>
<p>When you suspect an always statement is producing a runtine infinite loop,
use this flag to find the always statements that need to have their logic
verified. it is expected that many of the warnings will be false
positives, since the code treats the value of all variables and signals as
indeterninite.</p>
</li>
<li><p>sensitivity-entire-vector</p>
<p>This enables warnings for when a part select with an “always &#64;*” statement
results in the entire vector being added to the implicit sensitivity
list. Although this behavior is prescribed by the IEEE standard, it is not
what might be expected and can have performance implications if the vector
is large.</p>
</li>
<li><p>sensitivity-entire-array</p>
<p>This enables warnings for when a word select with an “always &#64;*” statement
results in the entire array being added to the implicit sensitivity
list. Although this behavior is prescribed by the IEEE standard, it is not
what might be expected and can have performance implications if the array
is large.</p>
</li>
<li><p>floating-nets</p>
<p>This enables warnings for nets that are present but have no drivers.</p>
<p>This flag was added in version 11.0 or later (and is in the master branch
as of 2015-10-01).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>-y&lt;libdir&gt;</p>
<p>Append the directory to the library module search path. When the compiler
finds an undefined module, it looks in these directories for files with the
right name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-Y&lt;suf&gt;</p>
<p>Appends suf to the list of file extensions that are used to resolve an
undefined module to a file name. Should be specified before any -y flag. For
example, this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% iverilog -Y .sv -y sources src.v
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will try to resolve any undefined module m by looking into the directory
sources and checking if there exist files named m.v or m.sv.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preprocessor-flags">
<h2>Preprocessor Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#preprocessor-flags" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>These flags control the behavior of the preprocessor. They are similar to
flags for the typical “C” compiler, so C programmers will find them familiar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-E</p>
<p>This flag is special in that it tells the compiler to only run the
preprocessor. This is useful for example as a way to resolve preprocessing
for other tools. For example, this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% iverilog -E -ofoo.v -DKEY=10 src1.v src2.v
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>runs the preprocessor on the source files src1.v and src2.v and produces the
single output file foo.v that has all the preprocessing (including header
includes and ifdefs) processed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-D&lt;macro&gt;</p>
<p>Assign a value to the macro name. The format of this flag is one of:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-Dkey=value
-Dkey
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The key is defined to have the given value. If no value is given, then it is
assumed to be “1”. The above examples are the same as these defines in
Verilog source:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>`define key value
`define key
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>-I&lt;path&gt;</p>
<p>Append directory &lt;path&gt; to list of directories searched for Verilog include
files. The -I switch may be used many times to specify several directories
to search, the directories are searched in the order they appear on the
command line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="elaboration-flags">
<h2>Elaboration Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#elaboration-flags" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are flags that pass information to the elaboration steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>-P&lt;symbol&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</p>
<p>Define a parameter using the defparam behavior to override a parameter
values. This can only be used for parameters of root module instances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-s &lt;topmodule&gt;</p>
<p>Specify the top level module to elaborate. Icarus Verilog will by default
choose modules that are not instantiated in any other modules, but sometimes
that is not sufficient, or instantiates too many modules. If the user
specifies one or more root modules with “-s” flags, then they will be used
as root modules instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>-Tmin, -Ttyp, -Tmax</p>
<p>Select the timings to use. The Verilog language allows many timings to be
specified as three numbers, min:typical:max, but for simulation you need to
choose which set to use. The “-Tmin” flag tells the compiler to at
elaboration time choose “min” times. The default is “-Ttyp”.</p>

</ul>
