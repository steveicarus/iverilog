/*
 * This header file describes the API for the loadable target
 * module. The main program can load these modules and access the
 * functions within the loaded module to implement the backend
 * behavior.
 *
 * The interface is divided into two parts: the entry points within
 * the core that are called by the module, and the entry points in
 * the module that are called by the core. It is the latter that
 * causes the module to be invoked in the first place, but most of the
 * interesting information about the design is accessed through the
 * various access functions that the modules calls into the core.
 */


/*
 * In order to grab onto data in the design, the core passes cookies
 * to the various functions of the module. These cookies can in turn
 * be passed to access functions in the core to get more detailed
 * information.
 *
 * The following typedefs list the various cookies that may be passed
 * around.
 *
 * ivl_array_t
 *    This object represents an array that can be a memory or a net
 *    array. (They are the same from the perspective of ivl_target.h.)
 *
 * ivl_branch_t
 *    this object represents an analog branch.
 *
 * ivl_design_t
 *    This object represents the entire elaborated design. Various
 *    global properties and methods are available from this.
 *
 * ivl_event_t
 *    This object represents an event node. An event node stands for
 *    named events written explicitly in the Verilog, and net events
 *    that are implicit when @ statements are used.
 *
 * ivl_expr_t
 *    This object represents a node of an expression. If the
 *    expression has sub-expressions, they can be accessed from
 *    various method described below. The ivl_expr_type method in
 *    particular gets the type of the node in the form of an
 *    ivl_expr_type_t enumeration value.
 *
 *    Objects of this type represent expressions in processes.
 *    Structural expressions are instead treated as logic gates.
 *
 * ivl_island_t
 *    Certain types of objects may belong to islands. The island that
 *    they belong to is represented by the ivl_island_t cookie. To
 *    know if objects belong to the same island, it is sufficient to
 *    compare island cookies. If a==b, then island a is the same as
 *    island b.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_t
 *    This object is the base class for all the various LPM type
 *    device nodes. This object carries a few base properties
 *    (including a type) including a handle to the specific type.
 *
 * ivl_net_logic_t
 *    This object represents various built in logic devices. In fact,
 *    this includes just about every directional device that has a
 *    single output, including logic gates and nmos, pmos and cmos
 *    devices. There is also the occasional Icarus Verilog creation.
 *    What is common about these devices is that they are
 *    bitwise. That is, when fed a vector, they produce a vector
 *    result where each bit of the output is made only from the same
 *    bits in the vector inputs.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_t
 *    Structural links within an elaborated design are connected
 *    together at each bit. The connection point is a nexus, so pins
 *    of devices refer to an ivl_nexus_t. Furthermore, from a nexus
 *    there are backward references to all the device pins that point
 *    to it.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_t
 *    Scopes have zero or more parameter objects that represent
 *    parameters that the source defined. The parameter has a value
 *    that is fully elaborated, with defparams and other parameter
 *    overrides taken care of.
 *
 * ivl_process_t
 *    A Verilog process is represented by one of these. A process may
 *    be an "initial" or an "always" process. These come from initial
 *    or always statements from the Verilog source.
 *
 * ivl_scope_t
 *    Elaborated scopes within a design are represented by this
 *    type. Objects of this type also act as containers for scoped
 *    objects such as signals.
 *
 * ivl_statement_t
 *    Statements within processes are represented by one of these. The
 *    ivl_process_t object holds one of these, but a statement may in
 *    turn contain other statements.
 *
 * ivl_switch_t
 *    Switches are the tran/tranif devices in the design.
 *
 * -- A Note About Bit Sets --
 * Some objects hold a value as an array of bits. In these cases there
 * is some method that retrieves the width of the value and another
 * that returns a "char*". The latter is a pointer to the least
 * significant bit value. Bit values are represented by the characters
 * '0', '1', 'x' and 'z'. Strengths are stored elsewhere.
 *
 * -- A Note About Names --
 * The names of objects are complete, hierarchical names. That is,
 * they include the instance name of the module that contains them.
 *
 * basenames are the name of the object without the containing
 * scope. These names are unique within a scope, but not necessarily
 * throughout the design.

/* DESIGN
 * When handed a design (ivl_design_t) there are a few things that you
 * can do with it. The Verilog program has one design that carries the
 * entire program. Use the design methods to iterate over the elements
 * of the design.
 *
 * ivl_design_delay_sel
 *    Returns the tool delay selection: "MINIMUM", "TYPICAL" or "MAXIMUM"?
 *
 * ivl_design_flag
 *    This function returns the string value of a named flag. Flags
 *    come from the "-pkey=value" options to the iverilog command and
 *    are stored in a map for this function. Given the key, this
 *    function returns the value.
 *
 *    The special key "-o" is the argument to the -o flag of the
 *    command line (or the default if the -o flag is not used) and is
 *    generally how the target learns the name of the output file.
 *
 * ivl_design_process
 *    This function scans the processes (threads) in the design. It
 *    calls the user supplied function on each of the processes until
 *    one of the functors returns non-0 or all the processes are
 *    scanned. This function will return 0, or the non-zero value that
 *    was returned from the last scanned process.
 *
 * ivl_design_root (ANACHRONISM)
 *    A design has a root named scope that is an instance of the top
 *    level module in the design. This is a hook for naming the
 *    design, or for starting the scope scan.
 *
 * ivl_design_roots
 *    A design has some number of root scopes. These are the starting
 *    points for structural elaboration. This function returns to the
 *    caller a pointer to an ivl_scope_t array, and the size of the
 *    array.
 *
 * ivl_design_time_precision
 *    A design as a time precision. This is the size in seconds (a

/* EXPRESSIONS
 *
 * These methods operate on expression objects from the
 * design. Expressions mainly exist in behavioral code. The
 * ivl_expr_type() function returns the type of the expression node,
 * and the remaining functions access value bits of the expression.
 *
 * ivl_expr_signed
 *    This method returns true (!= 0) if the expression node
 *    represents a signed expression. It is possible for sub-
 *    expressions to be unsigned even if a node is signed, but the
 *    IVL core figures all this out for you. At any rate, this method
 *    can be applied to any expression node.
 *
 * ivl_expr_sized
 *    This method returns false (0) if the expression node does not
 *    have a defined size. This is unusual, but may happen for
 *    constant expressions.
 *
 * ivl_expr_type
 *    Get the type of the expression node. Every expression node has a
 *    type, which can affect how some of the other expression methods
 *    operate on the node
 *
 * ivl_expr_value
 *    Get the data type of the expression node. This uses the variable
 *    type enum to express the type of the expression node.
 *
 * ivl_expr_net_type
 *    This is used in some cases to carry more advanced type
 *    descriptions. Over the long run, all type information will be
 *    moved into the ivl_type_t type description method.
 *
 * ivl_expr_width
 *    This method returns the bit width of the expression at this
 *    node. It can be applied to any expression node, and returns the
 *    *output* width of the expression node.
 *
 * ivl_expr_parameter
 *    This function returns the ivl_parameter_t object that represents
 *    this object, or 0 (nil) if it is not a parameter value. This
 *    function allows the code generator to detect the case where the
 *    expression is a parameter. This will normally only return a
 *    non-nil value for constants.
 *
 * ivl_expr_opcode
 *    IVL_EX_BINARY and IVL_EX_UNARY expression nodes include an
 *    opcode from this table:
 *              &   -- AND
 *              A   -- NAND (~&)
 *              X   -- XNOR (~^)
 *              *   -- Multiply
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 *
 * - IVL_EX_ARRAY
 * This expression type is a special case of the IVL_EX_SIGNAL where
 * the target is an array (ivl_signal_t with an array_count) but there
 * is no index expression. This is used only in the special situation
 * where the array is passed to a system task/function. The function
 * ivl_expr_signal returns the ivl_signal_t of the array object, and
 * from that all the properties of the array can be determined.
 *
 * - IVL_EX_BINARY
 *
 * - IVL_EX_PROPERTY
 * This expression represents the property select from a class
 * type, for example "foo.property" where "foo" is a class handle and
 * "property" is the name of one of the properties of the class. The
 * ivl_expr_signal function returns the ivl_signal_t for "foo" and the
 * data_type for the signal will be IVL_VT_CLASS.
 *
 * The ivl_signal_net_type(sig) for the "foo" signal will be a class
 * type and from there you can get access to the type information.
 *
 * Elaboration reduces the properties of a class to a vector numbered
 * from 0 to the number of properties. The ivl_expr_property_idx()
 * function gets the index of the selected property into the property
 * table. That number can be passed to ivl_type_prop_*() functions to
 * get details about the property.
 *
 * If the property is an array, then the ivl_expr_oper1() function
 * returns the canonical expression for accessing the element of the
 * property.
 *
 * - IVL_EX_NEW
 * This expression takes one or two operands. The first operand,
 * returned by ivl_expr_oper1() is the number of elements to create
 * for the dynamic array. The second operand, if present, is returned
 * by the ivl_expr_oper2() function. If this returns a non-nil
 * expression, it is the initial value to be written to the elements
 * of the array. If the expression is an IVL_EX_ARRAY_PATTERN, then
 * this is the very special case of a list of values to be written to
 * array elements.
 *
 * - IVL_EX_SELECT
 * This expression takes two operands, oper1 is the expression to
 * select from, and oper2 is the selection base. The ivl_expr_width
 * value is the width of the bit/part select. The ivl_expr_oper1 value
 * is the base of a vector. The compiler has already figured out any
 * conversion from signal units to vector units, so the result of
 * ivl_expr_oper1 should range from 0 to ivl_expr_width().
 *
 * This expression is also used to implement string substrings. If the
 * sub-expression (oper1) is IVL_VT_STRING, then the base expression
 * (oper2) is a character address, with 0 the first address of the
 * string, 1 the second, and so on. This is OPPOSITE how a part select
 * of a string cast to a vector works, to be aware. The size of the
 * expression is an even multiple of 8, and is 8 times the number of
 * characters to pick.
 *
 * - IVL_EX_SIGNAL
 * This expression references a signal vector. The ivl_expr_signal
 * function gets a handle for the signal that is referenced. The
 * signal may be an array (see the ivl_signal_array_count function)
 * that is addressed by the expression returned by the ivl_expr_oper1
 * function. This expression returns a *canonical* address. The core
 * compiler already corrected the expression to account for index
 * bases.
 *
 * The ivl_expr_width function returns the vector width of the signal
 * word. The ivl_expr_value returns the data type of the word.
 *
 * Bit and part selects are not done here. The IVL_EX_SELECT
 * expression does bit/part selects on the word read from the signal.
 *
 * - IVL_EX_STRING
 * This expression refers to a string constant. The ivl_expr_string
 * function returns a pointer to the first byte of the string. The
 * compiler has translated it to a "vvp escaped string" which has
 * quoting and escapes eliminated. The string may contain octal
 * escapes (\<oct>) so that the string text returned by
 * ivl_expr_string will only contain graphical characters. It is up to
 * the target to change the escaped \NNN to the proper byte value when
 * using this string. No other escape sequences will appear in the
 * string. Quote (") and slash (\) characters will be delivered in
 * \NNN form.

/* LOGIC
 * These types and functions support manipulation of logic gates. The
 * ivl_logic_t enumeration identifies the various kinds of gates that
 * the ivl_net_logic_t can represent. The various functions then
 * provide access to the bits of information for a given logic device.
 *
 * The ivl_net_logic_t nodes are bit-slice devices. That means that
 * the device may have width (and therefore processes vectors) but
 * each bit slice of the width is independent.
 *
 * ivl_logic_type
 *    This method returns the type of logic gate that the node
 *    represents. The logic type implies the meaning of the various pins.
 *
 * ivl_logic_name (obsolete)
 *    This method returns the complete name of the logic gate. Every
 *    gate has a complete name (that includes the scope) even if the
 *    Verilog source doesn't include one. The compiler will choose one
 *    if necessary.
 *
 * ivl_logic_basename
 *    This is the name of the gate without the scope part.
 *
 * ivl_logic_scope
 *    This is the scope that directly contains the logic device.
 *
 * ivl_logic_pins
 * ivl_logic_pin
 *    Return the nexus for the pin. If two pins are connected
 *    together, then these values are the same. Use the nexus
 *    functions to find other pins that are connected to this nexus.
 *
 * ivl_logic_width
 *    This returns the width of the logic array. This does not affect
 *    the number of pins, but implies the width of the vector at each
 *    pin.
 *
 * ivl_logic_delay
 *    Logic devices have a delay for each transition (0, 1 and Z).
 *
 * ivl_logic_attr (obsolete)
 *    Return the value of a specific attribute, given the key name as
 *    a string. If the key is not defined, then return 0 (null).
 *
 * ivl_logic_attr_cnt
 * ivl_logic_attr_val
 *    These support iterating over logic attributes. The _cnt method
 *    returns the number of attributes attached to the gate, and the
 *    ivl_logic_attr_val returns the value of the attribute.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 * The ivl_logic_width applies to all the pins of a logic device. If a
 * logic device has width, that means that it is actually an array of
 * logic devices that each process a bit slice of the
 * inputs/output. That implies that the widths of all the inputs and
 * the output must be identical.
 *
 * The ivl_logic_width  and ivl_logic_pins are *not* related. A logic
 * device has a number of pins that is the number of inputs to a logic
 * array of identical gates, and the ivl_logic_width, is the width of
 * the vector into each input pin and out of the output pin.
 *
 * The output pin is pin-0. The ivl_logic_driveX functions return the
 * drive strengths for the output pin-0, and match the drive values
 * stored in the ivl_nexus_ptr_t object for the pin.
 *
 * Logic devices have a logic propagation delay. The delay can be any
 * expression, although the most common expression is an IVL_EX_NUMBER
 * for a number value. The expression already includes scaling for the
 * containing module, so the delay value is always taken to be in
 * simulation clock ticks.
 *
 * If the delay is present, then ivl_logic_delay returns a non-nil
 * object. If any of the three delays is present, then all three are
 * present, even if they are all the same. The compiler will translate
 * shorthands into a complete set of delay expressions.
 *
 * The ivl_logic_delay expression will always be an IVL_EX_NUMBER, an
 * IVL_EX_ULONG, or an IVL_EX_SIGNAL. These expressions can easily be
 * used in structural contexts. The compiler will take care of
 * elaborating more complex expressions to nets.
 *
 * - IVL_LO_PULLUP/IVL_LO_PULLDOWN
 * These devices are grouped as logic devices with zero inputs because
 * the outputs have the same characteristics as other logic
 * devices. They are special only in that they have zero inputs, and
 * their drivers typically have strength other than strong.
 *
 * - IVL_LO_UDP
 * User defined primitives (UDPs) are like any other logic devices, in
 * that they are bit-slice devices. If they have a width, then they
 * are repeated to accommodate that width, and that implies that the
 * output and all the inputs must have the same width.
 *
 * The IVL_LO_UDP represents instantiations of UDP devices. The
 * ivl_udp_t describes the implementation.

/* LPM
 * These functions support access to the properties of LPM
 * devices. LPM devices are a variety of devices that handle more
 * complex structural semantics. They are based on EIA LPM standard
 * devices, but vary to suite the technical situation.
 *
 * These are the functions that apply to all LPM devices:
 *
 * ivl_lpm_name (Obsolete)
 * ivl_lpm_basename
 *    Return the name of the device. The name is the name of the
 *    device with the scope part, and the basename is without the scope.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_delay
 *    LPM devices have a delay for each transition (0, 1 and Z).
 *
 * ivl_lpm_scope
 *    LPM devices exist within a scope. Return the scope that contains
 *    this device.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_type
 *    Return the ivl_lpm_type_t of the specific LPM device.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_width
 *    Return the width of the LPM device. What this means depends on
 *    the LPM type, but it generally has to do with the width of the
 *    output data path.
 *
 *
 * These functions apply to a subset of the LPM devices, or may have
 * varying meaning depending on the device:
 *
 * ivl_lpm_base
 *    The IVL_LPM_PART objects use this value as the base (first bit)
 *    of the part select. The ivl_lpm_width is the size of the part.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_data
 *    Return the input data nexus for device types that have input
 *    vectors. The "idx" parameter selects which data input is selected.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_datab (ANACHRONISM)
 *    This is the same as ivl_lpm_data(net,1), in other words the
 *    second data input. Use the ivl_lpm_data method instead.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_q
 *    Return the output data nexus for device types that have a single
 *    output vector. This is most devices, it turns out.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_selects
 *    This is the size of the select input for a LPM_MUX device, or the
 *    address bus width of an LPM_RAM.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_signed
 *    Arithmetic LPM devices may be signed or unsigned if there is a
 *    distinction. For some devices this gives the signedness of the
 *    output, but not all devices.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_size
 *    In addition to a width, some devices have a size. The size is
 *    often the number of inputs per out, i.e., the number of inputs
 *    per bit for a MUX.
 *
 * ivl_lpm_trigger
 *    SFUNC and UFUNC devices may have a trigger that forces the
 *    function output to be re-evaluated.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 *
 * - Concatenation (IVL_LPM_CONCAT)
 * These devices take vectors in and combine them to form a single
 * output the width specified by ivl_lpm_width.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_q nexus is the output from the concatenation.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_data function returns the connections for the inputs to
 * the concatenation. The ivl_lpm_size function returns the number of
 * inputs help by the device.
 *
 * - Divide (IVL_LPM_DIVIDE)
 * The divide operators take two inputs and generate an output. The
 * ivl_lpm_width returns the width of the result. The width of the
 * inputs are their own.
 *
 * - Multiply (IVL_LPM_MULT)
 * The multiply takes two inputs and generates an output. Unlike other
 * arithmetic nodes, the width only refers to the output. The inputs
 * have independent widths, to reflect the arithmetic truth that the
 * width of a general multiply is the sum of the widths of the
 * inputs. In fact, the compiler doesn't assure that the widths of the
 * inputs add up to the width of the output, but the possibility
 * exists. It is *not* an error for the sum of the input widths to be
 * more than the width of the output, although the possibility of
 * overflow exists at run time.
 *
 * The inputs are always treated as unsigned. If the expression is
 * supposed to be signed, elaboration will generate the necessary sign
 * extension, so the target need not (must not) consider signedness.
 *
 * - Power (IVL_LPM_POW)
 * The power takes two inputs and generates an output. Unlike other
 * arithmetic nodes, the width only refers to the output. The inputs
 * have independent widths, to reflect the arithmetic truth that the
 * width of a general power is the XXXX of the widths of the
 * inputs.
 *
 * Power may be signed. This indicates the type of the exponent. The
 * base will always be treated as unsigned. The compiler must ensure
 * the width of the base is equal to the width of the output to
 * obtain the correct result when the base is really a signed value.
 *
 * - Part Select (IVL_LPM_PART_VP and IVL_LPM_PART_PV)
 * There are two part select devices, one that extracts a part from a
 * vector, and another that writes a part of a vector. The _VP is
 * Vector-to-Part, and _PV is Part-to-Vector. The _VP form is meant to
 * model part/bin selects in r-value expressions, where the _PV from
 * is meant to model part selects in l-value nets.
 *
 * In both cases, ivl_lpm_data(0) is the input pin, and ivl_lpm_q is the
 * output. In the case of the _VP device, the vector is input and the
 * part is the output. In the case of the _PV device, the part is the
 * input and the vector is the output.
 *
 * If the base of the part select is non-constant, then
 * ivl_lpm_data(1) is non-nil and is the select, or base, address of
 * the part. If this pin is nil, then the constant base is used
 * instead.
 *
 * Also in both cases, the width of the device is the width of the
 * part. In the _VP case, this is obvious as the output nexus has the
 * part width. In the _PV case, this is a little less obvious, but
 * still correct. The output being written to the wider vector is
 * indeed the width of the part, even though it is written to a wider
 * gate. The target will need to handle this case specially.
 *
 * - Bi-directional Part Select (IVL_LPM_PART_BI)
 * This is not exactly a part select but a bi-directional partial link
 * of two nexa with different widths. This is used to implement tran
 * devices and inout ports in certain cases. The device width is the
 * width of the part. The ivl_lpm_q is the part end, and the
 * ivl_lpm_data(0) is the non-part end.
 *
 * - Comparisons (IVL_LPM_CMP_GT/GE/EQ/NE/EEQ/NEE/EQX/EQZ)
 * These devices have two inputs, available by the ivl_lpm_data()
 * function, and one output available by the ivl_lpm_q function. The
 * output width is always 1, but the ivl_lpm_width() returns the width
 * of the inputs. Both inputs must have the same width.
 *
 * The CMP_GE and CMP_GT nodes may also be signed or unsigned, with
 * the obvious implications. The widths are matched by the compiler
 * (so the target need not worry about sign extension) but when doing
 * magnitude compare, the signedness does matter. In any case, the
 * result of the compare is always unsigned.
 *
 * The EQX and EQZ nodes are wildcard compares, where xz bits (EQX) or
 * z bits (EQZ) in the data(1) operand are treated as wildcards. no
 * bits in the data(0) operand are wild. This matches the
 * SystemVerilog convention for the ==? operator.
 *
 * - Mux Device (IVL_LPM_MUX)
 * The MUX device has a q output, a select input, and a number of data
 * inputs. The ivl_lpm_q output and the ivl_lpm_data inputs all have
 * the width from the ivl_lpm_width() method. The Select input, from
 * ivl_lpm_select, has the width ivl_lpm_selects().
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_data() method returns the inputs of the MUX device. The
 * ivl_lpm_size() method returns the number of data inputs there
 * are. All the data inputs have the same width, the width of the
 * ivl_lpm_q output. The type of the device is divined from the
 * inputs and the Q. All the types must be exactly the same.
 *
 * - D-FlipFlop (IVL_LPM_FF)
 * This device is an edge sensitive register. The ivl_lpm_q output and
 * single ivl_lpm_data input are the same width, ivl_lpm_width. This
 * device carries a vector like other LPM devices.
 *
 * - Latch (IVL_LPM_LATCH)
 * This device is an asynchronous latch. The ivl_lpm_q output and
 * single ivl_lpm_data input are the same width, ivl_lpm_width. This
 * device carries a vector like other LPM devices.
 *
 * - Memory port (IVL_LPM_RAM) (deprecated in favor of IVL_LPM_ARRAY)
 * These are structural ports into a memory device. They represent
 * address/data ports of a memory device that the context can hook to
 * for read or write. Read devices have an ivl_lpm_q output port that
 * is the data being read.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_memory function returns the ivl_memory_t for the memory
 * that the port access. The ivl_lpm_width for the port then must
 * match the ivl_memory_width of the memory device.
 *
 * Read or write, the ivl_lpm_select nexus is the address. The
 * ivl_lpm_selects function returns the vector width of the
 * address. The range of the address is always from 0 to the memory
 * size-1 -- the canonical form. It is up to the compiler to generate
 * offsets to correct for a range declaration.
 *
 * Read ports use the ivl_lpm_q as the data output, and write ports
 * use the ivl_lpm_data(0) as the input. In either case the width of
 * the vector matches the width of the memory itself.
 *
 * - Reduction operators (IVL_LPM_RE_*)
 * These devices have one input, a vector, and generate a single bit
 * result. The width from the ivl_lpm_width is the width of the input
 * vector.
 *
 * - Repeat Node (IVL_LPM_REPEAT)
 * This node takes as input a single vector, and outputs a single
 * vector. The ivl_lpm_width if this node is the width of the *output*
 * vector. The ivl_lpm_size() returns the number of times the input is
 * repeated to get the desired width. The ivl core assures that the
 * input vector is exactly ivl_lpm_width() / ivl_lpm_size() bits.
 *
 * - Sign Extend (IVL_LPM_SIGN_EXT)
 * This node takes a single input and generates a single output. The
 * input must be signed, and the output will be a vector sign extended
 * to the desired width. The ivl_lpm_width() value is the output
 * width, the input will be whatever it wants to be.
 *
 * - Shifts (IVL_LPM_SHIFTL/SHIFTR)
 * This node takes two inputs, a vector and a shift distance. The
 * ivl_lpm_data(0) nexus is the vector input, and the ivl_lpm_data(1)
 * the shift distance. The vector input is the same width as the
 * output, but the distance has its own width.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_signed() flag means for IVL_LPM_SHIFTR that the right
 * shift is *signed*. For SHIFTL, then signed-ness is meaningless.
 *
 * - System function call (IVL_LPM_SFUNC)
 * This device represents a netlist call to a system function. The
 * inputs to the device are passed to a system function, and the
 * result is sent via the output. The ivl_lpm_q function returns the
 * output nexus.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_size function returns the number of arguments, and the
 * ivl_lpm_data(net,N) returns the nexa for the argument.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_string(net) function returns the name of the system
 * function (i.e. "$display") that was found in the source code. The
 * compiler does little checking of that name.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_trigger function retrieves the trigger event that
 * indicates when the system function needs to be re-evaluated. If
 * there is no trigger event, the system function only needs to be
 * re-evaluated when a change is detected on its input ports.
 *
 * - User Function Call (IVL_LPM_UFUNC)
 * This device is special as it represents a call to a user defined
 * function (behavioral code) within a netlist. The inputs to the
 * function are connected to the net, as is the output.
 *
 * The function definition is associated with a scope, and the
 * ivl_lpm_define function returns the scope that is that definition.
 * See the ivl_scope_* functions for how to get at the actual
 * definition.
 *
 * As with many LPM nodes, the ivl_lpm_q function returns the nexus
 * for the signal function return value. The width of this nexus must
 * exactly match the width of the device from ivl_lpm_width.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_data function retrieves the nexa for all the input
 * ports. The ivl_lpm_size function returns the number of inputs for
 * the device, and the ivl_lpm_data() function index argument selects
 * the port to retrieve. Each port is sized independently.
 *
 * The ivl_lpm_trigger function retrieves the trigger event that
 * indicates when the user function needs to be re-evaluated. If
 * there is no trigger event, the user function only needs to be
 * re-evaluated when a change is detected on its input ports.

/* LVAL
 * The l-values of assignments are concatenation of ivl_lval_t
 * objects. Each lvi_lval_t object is an assignment to a var or a
 * memory, through a bit select, part select or word select.
 *
 * Var lvals are things like assignments to a part select or a bit
 * select. Assignment to the whole variable is a special case of a
 * part select, as is a bit select with a constant expression.
 *
 * ivl_lval_width
 *    The width of a vector that this lval can receive. This accounts
 *    for the local part selecting I might to in the lval object, as
 *    well as the target object width.
 *
 * ivl_lval_mux (* obsolete *)
 *
 * ivl_lval_nest
 *    If the l-value is an object more complex than a variable, then
 *    this returns the nested l-value (and ivl_lval_sig==0).
 *
 * ivl_lval_sig
 *    If the l-value is a variable, this method returns the signal
 *    object that is the target of the assign.
 *
 * ivl_lval_part_off
 *    The part select of the signal is based here. This is the
 *    canonical index of bit-0 of the part select. The return value is
 *    an ivl_expr_t. If the return value is nil, then take the offset
 *    as zero. Otherwise, evaluate the expression to get the offset.
 *
 * ivl_lval_idx
 *    If the l-value is a memory, this method returns an
 *    ivl_expr_t that represents the index expression.  Otherwise, it
 *    returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_lval_property_idx
 *    If the l-value is a class object, this is the name of a property
 *    to select from the object. If this property is not present (<0)
 *    then the l-value represents the class object itself.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 * The ivl_lval_width is not necessarily the same as the width of the
 * signal or memory word it represents. It is the width of the vector
 * it receives and assigns. This may be less than the width of the
 * signal (or even 1) if only a part of the l-value signal is to be
 * assigned.
 *
 * The ivl_lval_part_off is the canonical base of a part or
 * bit select.
 *
 * - Array words
 * If the l-value is an array, then ivl_lval_idx function will return
 * an expression that calculates the address of the array word. If
 * the referenced signal has more than one word, this expression must
 * be present. If the signal has exactly one word (it is not an array)
 * then the ivl_lval_idx expression must *not* be present.
 *
 * For array words, the ivl_lval_width is the width of the word.
 *
 * - Arrayed properties
 * If the l-value is a class property, then the ivl_lval_idx function
 * will return an expression if the property is in fact arrayed. The
 * expression is the canonical index for elements in the property.

/* NEXUS
 * connections of signals and nodes is handled by single-bit
 * nexus. These functions manage the ivl_nexus_t object. They also
 * manage the ivl_nexus_ptr_t objects that are closely related to the
 * nexus.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_name
 *    Each nexus is given a name, typically derived from the signals
 *    connected to it, but completely made up if need be. The name of
 *    every nexus is unique.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptrs
 *    This function returns the number of pointers that are held by
 *    the nexus. It should always return at least 1. The pointer
 *    proper is accessed by index.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr
 *    Return a nexus pointer given the nexus and an index.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_set_private
 * ivl_nexus_get_private
 *    The target module often needs to associate data with a nexus for
 *    later use when the nexus is encountered associated with a
 *    device. These methods allow the code generator to store to or
 *    retrieve from a nexus a void* of private data. This pointer is
 *    guaranteed to be 0 before the target module is invoked.
 *
 * Once an ivl_nexus_ptr_t is selected by the ivl_nexus_ptr method,
 * the properties of the pointer can be accessed by the following
 * methods:
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_pin
 *    This returns the pin number of the device where this nexus
 *    points. It is the bit within the signal or logic device that is
 *    connected to the nexus.
 *
 *    If the target is an LPM device, then this value is zero, and it
 *    is up to the application to find the pin that refers to this
 *    nexus. The problem is that LPM devices do not have a pinout per
 *    se, the pins all have specific names.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_con
 *    If this is a pointer to a magic constant device, then this
 *    returns the net_const object.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_drive0
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_drive1
 *    These are the 0 and 1 strength values for the devices. For most
 *    devices, these values are fixed by the description in the
 *    original source, with the default as IVL_DR_STRONG. For pins
 *    that are input only, drive0 and drive1 are both IVL_DR_HiZ.
 *
 *    The strength of strength-aware devices (such as nmos devices)
 *    does not really matter, as long as the output is not
 *    IVL_DR_HiZ. Testing for HiZ drivers is how code generators
 *    detect inputs.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_log
 *    If the target object is an ivl_net_logic_t, this method returns
 *    the object. Otherwise, this method returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_lpm
 *    If the target object is an ivl_lpm_t, this method returns the
 *    object. Otherwise, this method returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_nexus_ptr_sig
 *    If the target object is an ivl_signal_t, this method returns the
 *    object. If the target is not a signal, this method returns 0.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 * All the device pins that connect to a nexus have the same
 * type. That means, for example, that vector pins have the same
 * width. The compiler will insure this is so.

/* PARAMETER
 * Parameters are named constants associated with a scope. The user
 * may set in the Verilog source the value of parameters, and that
 * leads to ivl_parameter_t objects contained in the ivl_scope_t
 * objects.
 *
 * Parameters are essentially named constants. These constant values
 * can be accessed by looking at the scope (using ivl_scope_param) or
 * they can be discovered when they are used, via the
 * ivl_expr_parameter function. The fact that a constant has a name
 * (i.e. is a parameter) does not otherwise impose on the value or
 * interpretation of the constant expression so far as ivl_target is
 * concerned. The target may need this information, or may choose to
 * completely ignore it.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_basename
 *    return the name of the parameter.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_scope
 *    Return the scope of the parameter. The parameter name is only
 *    unique within its scope.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_expr
 *    Return the value of the parameter. This should be a simple
 *    constant expression, an IVL_EX_STRING or IVL_EX_NUMBER.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_msb
 * ivl_parameter_lsb
 *    Returns the MSB and LSB for the parameter. For a parameter without
 *    a range the value is zero based and the width of the expression is
 *    used to determine the MSB.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_width
 *    return |MSB - LSB| + 1
 *
 * ivl_parameter_signed
 *    Returns if the parameter was declared to be signed.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_local
 *    Return whether parameter was local (localparam, implicit genvar etc)
 *    or not.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_is_type
 *    Return whether the parameter is a type parameter or not.
 *
 * ivl_parameter_file
 * ivl_parameter_lineno
 *    Returns the file and line where this parameter is defined

/* SCOPE
 * Scopes of various sort have these properties. Use these methods to
 * access them. Scopes come to exist in the elaborated design
 * generally when a module is instantiated, though they also come from
 * named blocks, tasks and functions.
 *
 * - module instances (IVL_SCT_MODULE)
 *    A module instance scope may contain events, logic gates, lpm
 *    nodes, signals, and possibly children. The children are further
 *    instances, or function/task scopes. Module instances do *not*
 *    contain a definition.
 *
 * - function scopes (IVL_SCT_FUNCTION)
 *    These scopes represent functions. A function may not be a root,
 *    so it is contained within a module instance scope. A function is
 *    required to have a definition (in the form of a statement) and a
 *    signal (IVL_SIG_REG) that is its return value.
 *
 *    A single function scope is created each time the module with the
 *    definition is instantiated.
 *
 *
 * - task scopes (IVL_SCT_TASK)
 *    [...]
 *
 * ivl_scope_attr_cnt
 * ivl_scope_attr_val
 *    A scope may have attributes attached to it. These functions
 *    allow the target to access the attributes values.
 *
 * ivl_scope_children
 *    A scope may in turn contain other scopes. This method iterates
 *    through all the child scopes of a given scope. If the function
 *    returns any value other than 0, the iteration stops and the
 *    method returns that value. Otherwise, iteration continues until
 *    the children run out.
 *
 *    If the scope has no children, this method will return 0 and
 *    otherwise do nothing.
 *
 * ivl_scope_childs
 * ivl_scope_child
 *    This is an alternative way of getting at the childs scopes of a
 *    given scope.
 *
 * ivl_scope_def
 *    Task definition scopes carry a task definition, in the form of
 *    a statement. This method accesses that definition. The
 *    ivl_scope_def function must return a statement for scopes that
 *    are type FUNCTION or TASK, and must return nil otherwise.
 *
 * ivl_scope_def_file
 * ivl_scope_def_lineno
 *    Returns the file and line where this scope is defined.
 *
 * ivl_scope_enumerate
 * ivl_scope_enumerates
 *    Scopes have 0 or more enumeration types in them.
 *
 * ivl_scope_event
 * ivl_scope_events
 *    Scopes have 0 or more event objects in them.
 *
 * ivl_scope_file
 * ivl_scope_lineno
 *    Returns the instantiation file and line for this scope.
 *
 * ivl_scope_func_type
 * ivl_scope_func_signed
 * ivl_scope_func_width
 *
 *    If the scope is a function, these function can be used to get
 *    the type of the return value.
 *
 * ivl_scope_is_auto
 *    Is the task or function declared to be automatic?
 *
 * ivl_scope_is_cell
 *    Is the module defined to be a cell?
 *
 * ivl_scope_var
 * ivl_scope_vars
 *    REMOVED
 *
 * ivl_scope_log
 * ivl_scope_logs
 *    Scopes have 0 or more logic devices in them. A logic device is
 *    represented by ivl_logic_t.
 *
 * ivl_scope_lpm
 * ivl_scope_lpms
 *    Scopes have 0 or more LPM devices in them. These functions access
 *    those devices.
 *
 * ivl_scope_name
 * ivl_scope_basename
 *    Every scope has a hierarchical name. This name is also a prefix
 *    of all the names of objects contained within the scope. The
 *    ivl_scope_basename is the name of the scope without the included
 *    hierarchy.
 *
 * ivl_scope_param
 * ivl_scope_params
 *    A scope has zero or more named parameters. These parameters have
 *    a name and an expression value.
 *
 * ivl_scope_parent
 *    If this is a non-root scope, then the parent is the scope that
 *    contains this scope. Otherwise, the parent is nil.
 *
 * ivl_scope_port
 * ivl_scope_ports
 *    Scopes that are functions or tasks have ports defined by
 *    signals. These methods access the ports by name.
 *
 *    If this scope represents a function, then the ports list
 *    includes the return value, as port 0. The remaining ports are
 *    the input ports in order.
 *
 * ivl_scope_sig
 * ivl_scope_sigs
 *    Scopes have 0 or more signals in them. These signals are
 *    anything that can become and ivl_signal_t, include synthetic
 *    signals generated by the compiler.
 *
 * ivl_scope_time_precision
 *    Scopes have their own intrinsic time precision, typically from
 *    the timescale compiler directive. This method returns the
 *    precision as a signed power of 10 value.
 *
 * ivl_scope_time_units
 *    Scopes have their own intrinsic time units, typically from the
 *    timescale compiler directive. This method returns the units as a
 *    signed power of 10 value.
 *
 * ivl_scope_type
 * ivl_scope_tname
 *    Scopes have a type and a type name. For example, if a scope is
 *    an instance of module foo, its type is IVL_SCT_MODULE and its
 *    type name is "foo". This is different from the instance name
 *    returned by ivl_scope_name above.

/* SIGNALS
 * Signals are named things in the Verilog source, like wires and
 * regs, and also named things that are created as temporaries during
 * certain elaboration or optimization steps. A signal may also be a
 * port of a module or task.
 *
 * Signals have a name (obviously) and types. A signal may also be
 * signed or unsigned.
 *
 * ivl_signal_nex
 *    This is the nexus of the signal. This is used for managing
 *    connections to the rest of the net. There is exactly one pin for
 *    each word of a signal. Each word may in turn be a vector. The
 *    word address is the zero-based index for the word. It is up to
 *    the context to translate different bases to the canonical address.
 *
 * ivl_signal_array_base
 * ivl_signal_array_count
 * ivl_signal_array_addr_swapped
 *    The signal may be arrayed. If so, the array_count is >1. Each
 *    word of the array has its own nexus. The array_base is the
 *    address in the Verilog source for the canonical zero word. This
 *    may be negative, positive or zero. The array addresses may be
 *    reversed/swapped.
 *
 *    Note that arraying of the signal into words is distinct from the
 *    vectors. The width of a signal is the width of a WORD.
 *
 * ivl_signal_dimensions
 *    The signal may be an array (of vectors) in which case this
 *    function returns >0, the number of dimensions of the array.
 *
 * ivl_signal_discipline
 *    If the signal has been declared with a domain (Verilog-AMS) then
 *    this function will return a non-nil ivl_discipline_t.
 *
 * ivl_signal_msb (deprecated)
 * ivl_signal_lsb (deprecated)
 * ivl_signal_packed_dimensions
 * ivl_signal_packed_msb
 * ivl_signal_packed_lsb
 * ivl_signal_width
 *    These functions return the msb and lsb packed indices. The
 *    packed dimensions are declared differently from array
 *    dimensions, like so:
 *       reg [4:1][7:0] sig...
 *    which has two packed dimensions. The [4:1] dimension is the
 *    first, and so forth. If the signal is a scalar, it has 0
 *    dimension.
 *
 *    The ivl_signal_msb/ivl_signal_lsb functions are deprecated
 *    versions that only work with variables that have less than two
 *    dimensions. They will return msb==lsb==0 for scalars.
 *
 * ivl_signal_port
 *    If the signal is a port to a module, this function returns the
 *    port direction. If the signal is not a port, it returns
 *    IVL_SIP_NONE.
 *
 * ivl_signal_signed
 *    A signal, which is a vector, may be signed. In Verilog 2000, any
 *    net or variable may be signed. This function returns true if the
 *    signal is signed.
 *
 * ivl_signal_local
 *    A signal that was generated by the compiler as a place holder is
 *    marked as local.
 *
 * ivl_signal_forced_net
 *    Return whether the signal is a net that is the subject of a force
 *    statement.
 *
 * ivl_signal_type
 *    Return the type of the signal, i.e., reg, wire, tri0, etc.
 *
 * ivl_signal_data_type
 *    Return the data type of the signal, i.e. logic, real, bool,
 *    etc. All the signals connected to a nexus should have the same
 *    data type
 *
 * ivl_signal_npath
 * ivl_signal_path
 *    This function returns the delay path object for the signal. The
 *    delay path has this signal as the output, the source is attached
 *    to the delay path itself.
 *
 * ivl_signal_name (DEPRECATED)
 *    This function returns the fully scoped hierarchical name for the
 *    signal. The name refers to the entire vector that is the signal.
 *
 *    NOTE: This function is deprecated. The hierarchical name is too
 *    vague a construct when escaped names can have . characters in
 *    them. Do no use this function in new code, it will disappear.
 *
 * ivl_signal_basename
 *    This function returns the name of the signal, without the scope
 *    information. This is the tail of the signal name. Since Verilog
 *    has an escape syntax, this name can contain any ASCII
 *    characters, except NULL or white space. The leading \ and
 *    trailing ' ' of escaped names in Verilog source are not part of
 *    the name, so not included here.
 *
 * ivl_signal_attr
 *    Icarus Verilog supports attaching attributes to signals, with
 *    the attribute value (a string) associated with a key. This
 *    function returns the attribute value for the given key. If the
 *    key does not exist, the function returns 0.
 *
 * ivl_signal_file
 * ivl_signal_lineno
 *    Returns the file and line where this signal is defined.

 * make up the statement. Many of these functions apply to more than
 * one type of statement, so the comment in front of them tells which
 * statement types can be passed to the function.
 *
 * FUNCTION SUMMARY:
 *
 * ivl_stmt_block_scope
 *    If the block is named, then there is a scope associated with
 *    this. The code generator may need to know this in order to
 *    handle disable statements.
 *
 * ivl_stmt_events
 * ivl_stmt_needs_t0_trigger
 * ivl_stmt_nevent
 *    Statements that have event arguments (TRIGGER and WAIT) make
 *    those event objects available through these methods.
 *
* ivl_stmt_lval
 * ivl_stmt_lvals
 *    Return the number of l-values for an assignment statement, or
 *    the specific l-value. If there is more than 1 l-value, then the
 *    l-values are presumed to be vector values concatenated together
 *    from msb (idx==0) to lsb.
 *
 * ivl_stmt_rval
 *    Return the rval expression of the assignment. This is the value
 *    that is to be calculated and assigned to the l-value in all the
 *    assignment statements.
 *
 * ivl_stmt_sub_stmt
 *    Some statements contain a single, subordinate statement. An
 *    example is the IVL_ST_WAIT, which contains the statement to be
 *    executed after the wait completes. This method retrieves that
 *    sub-statement.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES:
 *
 * - Assignments: IVL_ST_ASSIGN, IVL_ST_ASSIGN_NB, IVL_CASSIGN, IVL_ST_FORCE
 *
 * The assignments support ivl_stmt_rval to get the r-value expression
 * that is to be assign to the l-value, and ivl_stmt_lval[s] to get
 * the l-value that receives the value. The compiler has already made
 * sure that the types (l-value and r-value) are compatible.
 *
 * If the l-value is a vector, then the compiler also makes sure the
 * expression width of the r-values matches. It handles padding or
 * operator sizing as needed to get the width exactly right.
 *
 * The blocking and non-blocking assignments may also have an internal
 * delay. These are of the form "lval = #<delay> rval;" and <delay> is
 * the internal delay expression. (It is internal because it is inside
 * the statement.) The ivl_stmt_delay_expr function returns the
 * expression for the delay, or nil if there is no delay expression.
 *
 * The blocking assignment (IVL_ST_ASSIGN) may have an associated
 * opcode, that can be extracted from ivl_stmt_opcode(). This opcode
 * is the compressed operator used it statements like this:
 *      foo += <expr>
 * The ivl_stmt_opcode() returns null (0) if this is not a compressed
 * assignment statement.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_CASSIGN
 * This reflects a procedural continuous assignment to an l-value. The
 * l-value is the same as any other assignment (use ivl_stmt_lval).
 *
 * The value to be assigned is an ivl_expr_t retrieved by the
 * ivl_stmt_rval function. The run time is expected to calculate the
 * value of the expression at the assignment, then continuous assign
 * that constant value. If the expression is non-constant, the code
 * generator is supposed to know what to do about that, too.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_CONTRIB
 * This is an analog contribution statement. The ivl_stmt_lexp
 * function returns the l-value expression which is guaranteed to be a
 * branch access expression. The ivl_stmt_rval returns the r-value
 * expression for the assignment.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_DELAY, IVL_ST_DELAYX
 * These statement types are delay statements. They are a way to
 * attach a delay to a statement. The ivl_stmt_sub_stmt() function
 * gets the statement to be executed after the delay. If this is
 * IVL_ST_DELAY, then the ivl_stmt_delay_val function gets the
 * constant delay. If this is IVL_ST_DELAYX, then the
 * ivl_stmt_delay_expr gets the expression of the delay. In this case,
 * the expression is not necessarily constant.
 *
 * Whether constant or calculated, the resulting delay is in units of
 * simulation ticks. The compiler has already taken care of converting
 * the delay to the time scale/precision of the scope.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_FORCE
 * This is very much like IVL_ST_CASSIGN, but adds that l-values can
 * include nets (tri, wire, etc). Memory words are restricted from
 * force l-values, and also non-constant bit or part selects. The
 * compiler will assure these constraints are met.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_FORLOOP
 * This contains the key portions of a for loop, broken into the init
 * statement, the sub statement, and the step statement. There is also
 * a condition expression that the code generator must check. It is up
 * to the target code generator to put these to use. In general, the
 * result needs to reflect this:
 *
 *      ivl_stmt_init_stmt(net);
 *      while( <ivl_stmt_cond_expr> is true ) {
 *          ivl_stmt_sub_stmt(net);
 *        continue_label:
 *          ivl_stmt_step_stmt(net);
 *      }
 *      out_label:
 *
 * - IVL_ST_TRIGGER
 * This represents the "-> name" statement that sends a trigger to a
 * named event. The ivl_stmt_nevent function should always return 1,
 * and the ivl_stmt_events(net,0) function returns the target event,
 * as an ivl_event_t. The only behavior of this statement is to send a
 * "trigger" to the target event.
 *
 * - IVL_ST_WAIT
 * This is the edge sensitive wait (for event) statement. The
 * statement contains an array of events that are to be tested, and a
 * single statement that is to be executed when any of the array of
 * events triggers.
 *
 * the ivl_stmt_events function accesses the array of events to wait
 * for, and the ivl_stmt_sub_stmt function gets the sub-statement,
 * which may be null, that is to be executed when an event
 * triggers. The statement waits even if the sub-statement is nul.

/* SWITCHES
 *
 * The switches represent the tran devices in the design.

 * FUNCTION SUMMARY
 *
 * ivl_switch_type
 *    Return the enumerated value that is the type of the switch.
 *
 * ivl_switch_basename
 *    This is the name given to the device in the source code.
 *
 * ivl_switch_a
 * ivl_switch_b
 *    The a and b ports are the two ports of the switch.
 *
 * ivl_switch_enable
 *    If the device has an enable (tranifX) then this is the enable
 *    port.
 *
 * SEMANTIC NOTES
 * The a/b ports can be any type, but the types must exactly
 * match, including vector widths. The enable must be a scalar.
 *
 * The IVL_SW_TRAN_VP is an exception to the above. In this case,
 * the B side may be a different size, and the a side will have a
 * a fixed width. The unused bits are padded to Z on the A side.
