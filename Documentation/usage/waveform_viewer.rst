Viewing Waveforms
=================

To view waveforms, either GTKWave or Surfer can be used.

GTKWave is a waveform viewer based on the GTK library. This viewer supports
VCD, FST, LXT, and LXT2 formats for waveform dumps. GTKWave is available on GitHub
`here <https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave>`_. Most Linux distributions already
include gtkwave prepackaged and there are binaries for Windows available.

Surfer is a waveform viewer based on the Rust egui library. This viewer supports
VCD and FST formats for waveform dumps. Surfer is available on GitLab
`here <https://gitlab.com/surfer-project/surfer>`_. It runs on Windows, Linux,
and MacOS, but can also run in a `web browser <https://app.surfer-project.org/>`_
and there is a VS Code
`extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=surfer-project.surfer>`_.

Generating waveform dump files for viewing
------------------------------------------

Waveform dumps are written by the Icarus Verilog runtime program vvp. The user
uses $dumpfile and $dumpvars system tasks to enable waveform dumping, then the
vvp runtime takes care of the rest. The output is written into the file
specified by the $dumpfile system task. If the $dumpfile call is absent, the
compiler will choose the file name dump.vcd, dump.lxt, or dump.fst, depending
on runtime flags. The example below dumps everything in and below the test
module:

.. code-block:: verilog

  // Do this in your test bench

  initial
  begin
     $dumpfile("test.vcd");
     $dumpvars(0,test);
  end

By default, the vvp runtime will generate VCD dump output. This is the default
because it is the most portable. However, when using gtkwave, the FST output
format is faster and most compact. Use the "-fst", "-lxt", or "-lxt2" extended
argument to activate FST, LXT, or LXT2 output, respectively. For example, if
your compiled output is written into the file "foo.vvp", the command:

.. code-block:: console

  % vvp foo.vvp -fst <other-plusargs>

will cause the dumpfile output to be written in FST format. Absent any
specific $dumpfile command, this file will be called dump.fst, which can be
viewed with GTKWave using the command:

.. code-block:: console

  % gtkwave dump.fst

A Working Example
-----------------

First, the design itself:

.. code-block:: verilog

  module counter(out, clk, reset);

    parameter WIDTH = 8;

    output [WIDTH-1 : 0] out;
    input            clk, reset;

    reg [WIDTH-1 : 0]   out;
    wire            clk, reset;

    always @(posedge clk)
      out <= out + 1;

    always @reset
      if (reset)
        assign out = 0;
      else
        deassign out;

  endmodule // counter

Then the simulation file:

.. code-block:: verilog

  module test;

    /* Make a reset that pulses once. */
    reg reset = 0;
    initial begin
       $dumpfile("test.vcd");
       $dumpvars(0,test);

       # 17 reset = 1;
       # 11 reset = 0;
       # 29 reset = 1;
       # 5  reset =0;
       # 513 $finish;
    end

    /* Make a regular pulsing clock. */
    reg clk = 0;
    always #1 clk = !clk;

    wire [7:0] value;
    counter c1 (value, clk, reset);

    initial
       $monitor("At time %t, value = %h (%0d)",
                $time, value, value);
  endmodule // test

Compile, run, and view waveforms with GTKWave using these commands:

.. code-block:: console

  % iverilog -o dsn counter_tb.v counter.v
  % vvp dsn
  % gtkwave test.vcd &

Click on the 'test', then 'c1' in the top left box of GTKWave, then drag the
signals to the Signals box. You will be able to add signals to display,
scanning by scope.
