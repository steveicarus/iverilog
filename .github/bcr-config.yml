# This file contains the centralized configuration for all BCR-related workflows.
# All GitHub Actions workflows will read from this file.
#
# To change configuration, edit the values below and commit the changes.

# Project name (used in archive naming)
project_name: iverilog

# BCR registry fork repository
# This is where the module will be published
bcr_registry_fork: MrAMS/bazel-central-registry

# Upstream repository
# Auto-detected from fork parent via GitHub API
# No manual configuration needed
upstream_url: auto-detected

# Release archive excludes
# These files/directories are removed from release archives
exclude_from_archive:
  - .git
  - .github
  - bazel-*
  - scripts
  - .gitmodules
  - .gitignore

# Sync schedule
# Monthly sync on the 1st day at 00:00 UTC
sync_schedule: "0 0 1 * *"
# Usage in workflows:
# - publish-to-bcr.yml: Reads project_name and bcr_registry_fork using yq
# - schedule-sync.yml: Uses sync_schedule and auto-detects upstream_url
# - All values are loaded dynamically at runtime
