<h1>VVP Simulation Engine<a class="headerlink" href="#vvp-simulation-engine" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The VVP simulator takes as input source code not unlike assembly
language for a conventional processor. It is intended to be machine
generated code emitted by other tools, including the Icarus Verilog
compiler, so the syntax, though readable, is not necessarily
convenient for humans.</p>
<section id="general-format">
<h2>General Format<a class="headerlink" href="#general-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The source file is a collection of statements. Each statement may have
a label, an opcode, and operands that depend on the opcode. For some
opcodes, the label is optional (or meaningless) and for others it is
required.</p>
<p>Every statement is terminated by a semicolon. The semicolon is also
the start of a comment line, so you can put comment text after the
semicolon that terminates a statement. Like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Label .functor and, 0x5a, x, y  ; This is a comment.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The semicolon is required, whether the comment is there or not.</p>
<p>Statements may span multiple lines, as long as there is no text (other
then the first character of a label) in the first column of the
continuation line.</p>
</section>
<section id="header-syntax">
<h2>Header Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#header-syntax" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before any other non-commentary code starts, the source may contain
some header statements. These are used for passing parameters or
global details from the compiler to the vvp run-time. In all cases,
the header statement starts with a left-justified keyword.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>:module “name” ;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This header statement names a vpi module that vvp should load before
the rest of the program is compiled. The compiler looks in the
standard VPI_MODULE_PATH for files named “name.vpi”, and tries to
dynamic load them.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>:vpi_time_precision [+|-]&lt;value&gt;;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This header statement specifies the time precision of a single tick of
the simulation clock. This is mostly used for display (and VPI)
purposes, because the engine itself does not care about units. The
compiler scales time values ahead of time.</p>
<p>The value is the size of a simulation tick in seconds, and is
expressed as a power of 10. For example, +0 is 1 second, and -9 is 1
nanosecond. If the record is left out, then the precision is taken to
be +0.</p>
</section>
<section id="labels-and-symbols">
<h2>Labels and Symbols<a class="headerlink" href="#labels-and-symbols" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Labels and symbols consist of the characters:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a-z
A-Z
0-9
.$_&lt;&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Labels and symbols may not start with a digit or a ‘.’, so that they
are easily distinguished from keywords and numbers. A Label is a
symbol that starts a statement. If a label is present in a statement,
it must start in the first text column. This is how the lexical
analyzer distinguishes a label from a symbol. If a symbol is present
in a statement, it is in the operand. Opcodes of statements must be a
keyword.</p>
<p>Symbols are references to labels. It is not necessary for a label to
be declared before its use in a symbol, but it must be declared
eventually. When symbols refer to functors, the symbol represents the
vvp_ipoint_t pointer to the output. (Inputs cannot, and need not, be
references symbolically.)</p>
<p>If the functor is part of a vector, then the symbol is the
vvp_ipoint_t for the first functor. The [] operator can then be used
to reference a functor other than the first in the vector.</p>
<p>There are some special symbols that in certain contexts have special
meanings. As inputs to functors, the symbols “C&lt;0&gt;”, “C&lt;1&gt;”, “C&lt;x&gt;”
and “C&lt;z&gt;” represent a constant driver of the given value.</p>
</section>
<section id="numbers">
<h2>Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#numbers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>decimal number tokens are limited to 64bits, and are unsigned. Some
contexts may constrain the number size further.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope-statements">
<h2>Scope Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The syntax of a scope statement is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .scope &lt;type&gt;, &lt;name&gt; &lt;type-name&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;lineno&gt; ;

&lt;label&gt; .scope &lt;type&gt;, &lt;name&gt; &lt;type-name&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;lineno&gt;, \
               &lt;def-file&gt; &lt;def-lineno&gt; &lt;is-cell&gt;, &lt;parent&gt; ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The &lt;type&gt; is the general type of the scope: module, autofunction,
function, autotask, task, begin, fork, autobegin, autofork, or generate.</p>
<p>The &lt;name&gt; is a string that is the base name of the instance. For
modules, this is the instance name. For tasks and functions, this is
the task or function name.</p>
<p>The &lt;type-name&gt; is the name of the type. For most scope types, this is
the name as the &lt;name&gt;, but for module and class scopes, this is the
name of the definition, and not the instance.</p>
<p>The &lt;file&gt; and &lt;lineno&gt; are the location of the instantiation of this
scope. For a module, it is the location of the instance.</p>
<p>The &lt;def-file&gt; and &lt;def-lineno&gt; is the source file and line number for
the definition of the scope. For modules, this is where the module is
defined instead of where it is instantiated.</p>
<p>The &lt;is-cell&gt; flag is only useful for module instances. It is true
(not zero) if the module is a celltype instead of a regular module.</p>
<p>The short form of the scope statement is only used for root scopes.</p>
</section>
<section id="parameter-statements">
<h2>Parameter Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Parameters are named constants within a scope. These parameters have a
type and value, and also a label so that they can be referenced as VPI
objects.</p>
<p>The syntax of a parameter is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .param/str &lt;name&gt; &lt;local-flag&gt; &lt;file-idx&gt; &lt;lineno&gt;, &lt;value&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .param/l &lt;name&gt; &lt;local-flag&gt; &lt;file-idx&gt; &lt;lineno&gt;, &lt;value&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .param/r &lt;name&gt; &lt;local-flag&gt; &lt;file-idx&gt; &lt;lineno&gt;, &lt;value&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The &lt;name&gt; is a string that names the parameter. The name is placed in
the current scope as a vpiParameter object. The .param suffix
specifies the parameter type:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>.param/str    -- The parameter has a string value
.param/l      -- The parameter has a logic vector value
.param/r      -- The parameter has a real value
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The value, then, is appropriate for the data type. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>P_123 .param/str &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;Hello, World.&quot;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The boolean and logic values can also be signed or not. If signed, the
value is preceded by a ‘+’ character. (Note that the value is 2s
complement, so the ‘+’ says only that it is signed, not positive.)</p>
</section>
<section id="functor-statements">
<h2>Functor Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#functor-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A functor statement is a statement that uses the <cite>.functor</cite>
opcode. Functors are the basic structural units of a simulation, and
include a type (in the form of a truth table) and up to four inputs. A
label is required for functors.</p>
<p>The general syntax of a functor is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .functor &lt;type&gt;, symbol_list ;
&lt;label&gt; .functor &lt;type&gt; [&lt;drive0&gt; &lt;drive1&gt;], symbol_list ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The symbol list is 4 names of labels of other functors. These connect
inputs of the functor of the statement to the output of other
functors. If the input is unconnected, use a C&lt;?&gt; symbol instead. The
type selects the truth lookup table to use for the functor
implementation. Most of the core gate types have built in tables.</p>
<p>The initial values of all the inputs and the output is x. Any other
value is passed around as run-time behavior. If the inputs have C&lt;?&gt;
symbols, then the inputs are initialized to the specified bit value,
and if this causes the output to be something other than x, a
propagation event is created to be executed at the start of run time.</p>
<p>The strengths of inputs are ignored by functors, and the output has
fixed drive0 and drive1 strengths. So strength information is
typically lost as it passes through functors.</p>
<p>Almost all of the structural aspects of a simulation can be
represented by functors, which perform the very basic task of
combining up to four inputs down to one output.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MUXZ</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Q | A  B  S  n/a
--+-------------
A | *  *  0
B | *  *  1

</div>

<section id="dff-and-latch-statements">
<h2>DFF and Latch Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#dff-and-latch-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Verilog language itself does not have a DFF primitive, but post
synthesis readily creates DFF devices that are best simulated with a
common device. Thus, there is the DFF statement to create DFF devices:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .dff/p &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .dff/n &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .dff/p/aclr &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;, &lt;async-input&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .dff/n/aclr &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;, &lt;async-input&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .dff/p/aset &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;, &lt;async-input&gt;[, &lt;set-value&gt;];
&lt;label&gt; .dff/n/aset &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;clk&gt;, &lt;ce&gt;, &lt;async-input&gt;[, &lt;set-value&gt;];
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The /p variants simulate positive-edge triggered flip-flops and the
/n variants simulate negative-edge triggered flip-flops. The generated
functor is generally synchronous on the specified edge of &lt;clk&gt;, with
the &lt;ce&gt; enable active high. The &lt;clk&gt; and &lt;ce&gt; are single bit vectors
(or scalars) on ports 1 and 2. Port-0 is any type of datum at all. The
device will transfer the input to the output when it is loaded by a
clock. The &lt;async-input&gt; is a special asynchronous input that on the
rising edge causes the device to clear/set, forces the output to
propagate, and disables the clock until the aynchronous input is
deasserted. Thus, they implement DFF with asynchronous clr or set.</p>
<p>Similarly, synthesis creates D-type latches, so there is the LATCH
statement to support this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .latch &lt;width&gt; &lt;d&gt;, &lt;en&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The &lt;en&gt; is a single bit vector (or scalar) on port-1. Port-0 is any
type of datum at all. The device will transfer the input to the output
whenever &lt;en&gt; is a logic 1.</p>

<section id="udp-statements">
<h2>UDP Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#udp-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A UDP statement either defines a User Defined Primitive, or
instantiates a previously defined UDP by creating a UDP functor.  A
UDP functor has as many inputs as the UDP definition requires.</p>
<p>UDPs come in sequential and combinatorial flavors.  Sequential UDPs
carry an output state and can respond to edges at the inputs.  The
output of combinatorial UDPs is a function of its current inputs
only.</p>
<p>The function of a UDP is defined via a table.  The rows of the table
are strings which describe input states or edges, and the new output
state.  Combinatorial UDPs require one character for each input, and
one character at the end for the output state.  Sequential UDPs need
an additional char for the current state, which is the first char of
the row.</p>
<p>Any input transition or the new state must match at most one row (or
all matches must provide the same output state).  If no row matches,
the output becomes 1’bx.</p>
<p>The output state can be specified as “0”, “1”, or “x”.  Sequential
UDPs may also have “-”: no change.</p>
<p>An input or current output state can be</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;1&quot;: 1
&quot;0&quot;: 0
&quot;x&quot;: x
&quot;b&quot;: 1, 0
&quot;h&quot;: 1, x
&quot;l&quot;: 0, x
&quot;?&quot;: 1, 0, x
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For Sequential UDPs, at most one input state specification may be
replaced by an edge specification.  Valid edges are:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;*&quot;: (??)       &quot;_&quot;: (?0)       &quot;+&quot;: (?1)       &quot;%&quot;: (?x)
&quot;P&quot;: (0?)                       &quot;r&quot;: (01)       &quot;Q&quot;: (0x)
&quot;N&quot;: (1?)       &quot;f&quot;: (10)                       &quot;M&quot;: (1x)
&quot;B&quot;: (x?)       &quot;F&quot;: (x0)       &quot;R&quot;: (x1)

&quot;n&quot;: (1?) | (?0)
&quot;p&quot;: (0?) | (?1)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A combinatorial UDP is defined like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;type&gt; .udp/comb &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;, &lt;number&gt;, &quot;&lt;row0&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;row1&gt;&quot;, ... ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&lt;type&gt; is a label that identifies the UDP.  &lt;number&gt; is the number of
inputs.  “&lt;name&gt;” is there for public identification.  Sequential UDPs
need an additional initialization value:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;type&gt; .udp/sequ &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;, &lt;number&gt;, &lt;init&gt;, &quot;&lt;row0&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;row1&gt;&quot;, ... ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&lt;init&gt; is the initial value for all instances of the UDP.  We do not
provide initial values for individual instances.  &lt;init&gt; must be a
number 0, 1, or 2 (for 1’bx).</p>
<p>A UDP functor instance is created so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .udp  &lt;type&gt;, &lt;symbol_list&gt; ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where &lt;label&gt; identifies the functor, &lt;type&gt; is the label of a UDP
defined earlier, and &lt;symbol_list&gt; is a list of symbols, one for each
input of the UDP.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-statements">
<h2>Variable Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A variable is a bit vector that can be written by behavioral code (so
has no structural input) and propagates its output to a functor. The
general syntax of a variable is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .var   &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt; &lt;lsb&gt;; Unsigned logic variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/s &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt; &lt;lsb&gt;; Signed logic variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/2u &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt; &lt;lsb&gt;; Unsigned bool/bit variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/2s &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt; &lt;lsb&gt;; Signed bool/bit variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/real &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;; real variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/i &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;; vpiIntegerVar variable
&lt;label&gt; .var/str &quot;name&quot;; vpiStringVar variable
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The “name” is the declared base name of the original variable, for the
sake of VPI code that might access it. The variable is placed in the
current scope. The variable also has a width, defined by the indices
for the most significant and lest significant bits. If the indices are
equal (normally 0) the vector has width of one. If the width is greater
then one, a contiguous array of functors is created and the value of
the label is the address of the least significant bit.</p>
<p>A variable does not take inputs, since its value is set behaviorally
by assignment events. It does have output, though, and its output is
propagated into the net of functors in the usual way.</p>
<p>A variable gets its value by assignments from procedural code: %set
and %assign. These instructions write values to the port-0 input. From
there, the value is held.</p>
<p>Behavioral code can also invoke %cassign/v statements that work like
%set/v, but instead write to port-1 of the variable node. Writes to
port-1 of a variable activate continuous assign mode, where the values
written to port-0 are ignored. The continuous assign mode remains
active until a long(1) is written to port-3 (a command port).</p>
<p>Behavioral code may also invoke %force/v statements that write to port-2
to invoke force mode. This overrides continuous assign mode until a
long(2) is written to port-3 to disable force mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="net-statements">
<h2>Net Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#net-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A net is similar to a variable, except that a thread cannot write to
it (unless it uses a force) and it is given a different VPI type
code. The syntax of a .net statement is also similar to but not
exactly the same as the .var statement:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .net      &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .net/s    &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .net8     &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .net8/s   &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .net/real &quot;name&quot;, &lt;msb&gt;, &lt;lsb&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Like a .var statement, the .net statement creates a VPI object with
the basename and dimensions given as parameters. The symbol is a
functor that feeds into the vector of the net, and the vpiHandle
holds references to that functor.</p>
<p>The input of a .net is replicated to its output. In this sense, it
acts like a diode. The purpose of this node is to hold various VPI
and event trappings. The .net and .net8 nodes are vector types. They
both may represent wires, but the .net8 nodes preserve strength values
that arrive through them, while .net nodes reduce strength values to
4-value logic. The .net8 nodes should only be used when strength
information really is possible.</p>
<p>The &lt;label&gt; is required and is used to locate the net object that it
represents. This label does not map to a functor, so only references
that know they want to access .nets are able to locate the symbol. In
particular, this includes behavioral %load and %wait instructions. The
references to net and reg objects are done through the .net label
instead of a general functor symbol. The instruction stores the
functor pointer, though.</p>
<p>The .alias statements do not create new nodes, but instead create net
names that are aliases of an existing node. This handles special cases
where a net has different names, possibly in different scopes.</p>
</section>
<section id="cast-statements">
<h2>Cast Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#cast-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes nets need to be cast from a real valued net to a bit based
net or from a bit based net to a real valued net. These statements
are used to perform that operation:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .cast/int &lt;width&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .cast/2 &lt;width&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .cast/real &lt;symbol&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .cast/real.s &lt;symbol&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For .cast/int the output &lt;label&gt; is a bit based net that is &lt;width&gt;
bits wide. The input &lt;symbol&gt; is expected to put real values to
this functor.</p>
<p>For .cast/real the output &lt;label&gt; is a real valued net. The input
&lt;symbol&gt; is expected to put bit based values and for .cast/real.s
the bits will be interpreted as a signed value.</p>
</section>
<section id="delay-statements">
<h2>Delay Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#delay-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Delay nodes are structural net delay nodes that carry and manage
propagation delays. Delay nodes can have fixed delays or variable
delays. Fixed delay nodes have only the input that is to be
delayed. The delay amount is given on the node line. Variable delay
nodes have three extra inputs to receive the rise, fall and decay
times that are used for delay.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>.delay &lt;width&gt; ( &lt;rise&gt;, &lt;fall&gt;, &lt;decay&gt; ) &lt;input&gt; ;

</div>
<p>The first form above takes three constant (64bit) numbers as the
initial delay, and takes a single input. The second form takes 4 net
inputs, with the first being the value to delay, and the remaining to

<h2>Event Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#event-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Threads need to interact with the functors of a netlist synchronously,
as well as asynchronously. There are cases where the web of functors
needs to wake up a waiting thread. The web of functors signals threads
through .event objects, that are declared like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .event &lt;type&gt;, &lt;symbols_list&gt;;
&lt;label&gt; .event &quot;name&quot;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This event statement declares an object that a %wait instruction
can take as an operand. When a thread executes a %wait, it puts
itself in the notification list of the event and suspends. The
&lt;symbols_list&gt; is a set of inputs that can trigger the event.</p>
<p>The &lt;type&gt; describes the conditions needed to trigger the event. It
may be posedge, negedge, edge or anyedge. If the type is instead a
“name” string, then this is a named event which receives events by
the %set instruction instead of from the output of a functor.</p>
<p>If the event has inputs (a requirement unless it is a named event)
then it has up to 4 symbols that address functors. The event then
detects the appropriate edge on any of the inputs and signals when the
event is true. Normally (in Verilog) a posedge or negedge event only
watches a single bit, so the generated code would only include a
single symbol for the addressed bit. However, if there are several
events of the same edge in an event OR expression, the compiler may
combine up to 4 into a single event.</p>
<p>If many more events need to be combined together (for example due to
an event or expression in the Verilog) then this form can be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .event/or &lt;symbols_list&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this case, the symbols list all the events that are to be combined
to trigger this event. Only one of the input events needs to trigger
to make this one go.</p>

<h2>Resolver Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#resolver-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Resolver statements are strength-aware functors with 4 inputs, but

<section id="part-select-statements">
<h2>Part Select Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#part-select-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Part select statements are functors with three inputs. They take in at
port-0 a vector, and output a selected (likely smaller) part of that
vector. The other inputs specify what those parts are, as a canonical
bit number, and a width. Normally, those bits are constant values.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .part &lt;symbol&gt;, &lt;base&gt;, &lt;wid&gt;;

&lt;label&gt; .part/v.s &lt;symbol&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt;, &lt;wid&gt;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The input is typically a .reg or .net, but can be any vector node in
the netlist.</p>
<p>The .part/pv variation is the inverse of the .part version, in that
the output is actually written to a <em>part</em> of the output. The node
uses special part-select-write functions to propagate a part of a
network. The &lt;vector_wid&gt; is the total width of the destination net
that part is written to. Destination nodes use this value to check
further output widths.</p>
<p>The .part/v variation takes a vector (or long) input on port-1 as the
base of the part select. Thus, the part select can move around. The
.part/v.s variation treats the vector as a signed value.</p>

<h2>Part Concatenation Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#part-concatenation-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The opposite of the part select statement is the part concatenation

vector values and produces a single vector output that is the
concatenation of all the inputs.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;label&gt; .concat [W X Y Z], &lt;symbols_list&gt; ;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The “[” and “]” tokens surround a set of 4 numbers that are the
expected widths of all the inputs. These widths are needed to figure
the positions of the input vectors in the generated output, and are
listed in order LSB to MSB. The inputs themselves are also listed LSB
to MSB, with the LSB vector input coming through port-0 of the real
functor.</p>
<p>The initial output value is (W+X+Y+Z) bits of ‘bx. As input values are
propagated, the bits are placed in the correct place in the output
vector value, and a new output value is propagated.</p>

<p>In this statement, the &lt;wid&gt; is a decimal number that is the width of
the <em>output</em> vector. The &lt;rept count&gt; is the number of time the input

<h2>Force Statements (new method - implement me)<a class="headerlink" href="#force-statements-new-method-implement-me" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A %force instruction, as described in the .var section, forces a
constant value onto a .var or .net, and the matching %release releases
that value. However, there are times when the value of a functor
(i.e. another .net) needs to be forced onto a .var or .net. For this
task, the %force/link instruction exists:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>%force/link &lt;dst&gt;, &lt;src&gt; ;

<p>This causes the output of the node &lt;src&gt; to be linked to the force
input of the &lt;dst&gt; .var/.net node. When linked, the output functor
will automatically drive values to the force port of the destination
node. The matching %release/link instruction removes the link (a
%release is still needed) to the destination. The %release/link
releases the last %force/link, no matter where the link is from. A new
%force/link will remove a previous link.</p>

<h2>Structural Compare Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#structural-compare-statements" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The arithmetic statements handle various arithmetic operators that

<p>Whereas the arithmetic statements generate an output the width of

         is useful for resolving time-0 races.
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Threads in general</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thread statements create the initial threads of a design. These
include the <cite>initial</cite> and <cite>always</cite> statements of the original
Verilog, and possibly some other synthetic threads for various
purposes. It is also possible to create transient threads from
behavioral code. These are needed to support such constructs as
fork/join, named blocks and task activation.</p>
<p>A transient thread is created with a %fork instruction. When a
transient thread is created this way, the operand to the %fork gives
the starting address, and the new thread is said to be a child of the
forking thread. The children of a thread are pushed onto a stack of
children. A thread can have only one direct child.</p>
<p>A transient thread is reaped with a %join instruction. %join waits for
the top thread in the stack of children to complete, then
continues. It is an error to %join when there are no children.</p>
<p>As you can see, the transient thread in VVP is a cross between a
conventional thread and a function call. In fact, there is no %call
instruction in vvp, the job is accomplished with %fork/%join in the
caller and %end in the callee. The %fork, then is simply a
generalization of a function call, where the caller does not
necessarily wait for the callee.</p>
<p>For all the behavior of threads and thread parentage to work
correctly, all %fork statements must have a corresponding %join in the
parent, and %end in the child. Without this proper matching, the
hierarchical relationships can get confused. The behavior of erroneous
code is undefined.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Thread Context</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The context of a thread is all the local data that only that thread
can address. The local data is broken into two address spaces: bit
memory and word memory.</p>
<p>The bit memory is a region of 4-value bits (0,1,x,z) that can be
addressed in strips of arbitrary length. For example, an 8-bit value
can be in locations 8 through and including 15. The bits at address 0,
1, 2 and 3 are special constant values. Reads from those locations
make vectors of 0, 1, x or z values, so these can be used to
manufacture complex values elsewhere.</p>
<p>The word memory is a region of tagged words. The value in each word
may be either a 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64_t), a 64-bit signed
integer (int64_t), or a 64-bit floating point number (double). These
words have a distinct address space from the bits.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Threads and scopes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Verilog <cite>disable</cite> statement deserves some special mention
because of how it interacts with threads. In particular, threads
throughout the design can affect (end) other threads in the design
using the disable statement.</p>
<p>In Verilog, the operand to the disable statement is the name of a
scope. The behavior of the disable is to cause all threads executing
in the scope to end. Termination of a thread includes all the children
of the thread. In vvp, all threads are in a scope, so this is how the
disable gains access to the desired thread.</p>
<p>It is obvious how initial/always thread join a scope. They become part
of the scope simply by being declared after a .scope declaration. (See
vvp.txt for .scope declarations.) The .thread statement placed in the
assembly source after a .scope statement causes the thread to join the
named scope.</p>
<p>Transient threads join a scope that is the operand to the %fork
instruction. The scope is referenced by name, and the thread created
by the fork atomically joins that scope. Once the transient thread
joins the scope, it stays there until it ends. Threads never change
scopes, not even transient threads.</p>

<p>The &lt;file-index&gt; is an index into the string table. The indexed string
is the source code file name where this call appears. The &lt;lineno&gt; is
the line number from the source code where this task/function appears.</p>
<p>The &lt;name&gt; is a string that is the name of the system

looked up and compared with the registered system tasks/functions.</p>
<p>The &lt;args&gt;… is a comma (“,”) separated list of arguments. These are
made available to the VPI code as vpi handles.</p>
<p>The plain %vpi_call will fail with an error message if a system function
is called as a task. The /w suffix version will display a warning message

<p>The &lt;symbol&gt; is the label for a signal, the &lt;base&gt; is the canonical
starting bit of the part select and &lt;width&gt; is the number of bits in
the select. The second form retrieves the &lt;base&gt; from the given signal
or &amp;A&lt;&gt;/&amp;PV&lt;&gt; select. The third form retrieves the &lt;base&gt; from thread
space using &lt;twid&gt; bits starting at &lt;tbase&gt;. The base value may be
signed or unsigned.</p>

<section id="truth-tables">
<h2>Truth Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#truth-tables" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The logic that a functor represents is expressed as a truth table. The
functor has four inputs and one output. Each input and output has one
of four possible values (0, 1, x and z) so two bits are needed to
represent them. So the input of the functor is 8 bits, and the output
2 bits. A complete lookup table for generating the 2-bit output from
an 8-bit input is 512 bits. That can be packed into 64 bytes. This is
small enough that the table should take less space than the code to
implement the logic.</p>
<p>To implement the truth table, we need to assign 2-bit encodings for
the 4-value signals. I choose, pseudo-randomly, the following
encoding:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1&#39;b0  : 00
1&#39;b1  : 01
1&#39;bx  : 10
1&#39;bz  : 11
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The table is an array of 64 bytes, each byte holding 4 2-bit
outputs. Construct a 6-bit byte address with inputs 1, 2 and 3 like
so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>332211
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The input 0 2-bits can then be used to select which of the 4 2-bit
pairs in the 8-bit byte are the output:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>MSB -&gt; zzxx1100 &lt;- LSB
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A complete truth table, then is described as 64 8-bit bytes.</p>
<p>The vvp engine includes truth tables for the primitive gate types, so
none needs to be given by the programmer. It is sufficient to name the
type to get that truth table.</p>

<section id="executable-instructions">
<h2>Executable Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#executable-instructions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Threads run executable code, much like a processor executes machine
code. VVP has a variety of opcodes for executable instructions. All of
those instructions start with ‘%’ and go into a single address
space. Labels attached to executable instructions get assigned the
address of the instruction, and can be the target of %jmp instructions
and starting points for threads.</p>
<p>The opcodes.txt file has a more detailed description of all the
various instructions.</p>

<section id="the-relationship-between-functors-threads-and-events">
<h2>The Relationship Between Functors, Threads And Events<a class="headerlink" href="#the-relationship-between-functors-threads-and-events" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the above summary of the major components of vvp, some
description of their relationship is warranted. Functors provide a
structural description of the design (so far as it can be described
structurally) and these functors run independently of the threads. In
particular, when an input to a functor is set, it calculates a new
output value; and if that output is different from the existing
output, a propagation event is created. Functor output is calculated
by truth table lookup, without the aid of threads.</p>
<p>Propagation events are one of three kinds of events in vvp. They are
scheduled to execute at some time, and they simply point to the functor
that is to have its output propagated. When the event expires, the
output of the referenced functor is propagated to all the inputs that
it is connected to, and those functors in turn create new events if
needed.</p>
<p>Assignment events (the second of three types of events) are created
by non-blocking assignments in behavioral code. When the <cite>&lt;=</cite> is
executed (a %assign in vvp) an assign event is created, which includes
the vvp_ipoint_t pointer to the functor input to receive the value,
as well as the value. These are distinct from propagation events because:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>There is no functor that has as its output the value to be
assigned (this is how values get into the functor net in
the first place), and</p></li>
<li><p>This allows for behavioral code to create waveforms of
arbitrary length that feed into a variable. Verilog allows
this of non-blocking assignments, but not of gate outputs.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The last type of event is the thread schedule event. This event simply
points to a thread to be executed. Threads are made up of a virtual
processor with a program counter and some private storage. Threads
can execute %assign instructions to create assignment events, and can
execute %set instructions to do blocking assignments. Threads can also
use %load to read the output of functors.</p>
<p>The core event scheduler takes these three kinds of events and calls
the right kind of code to cause things to happen in the design. If the
event is a propagate or assignment event, the network of functors is
tickled; if the event is a thread schedule, then a thread is run. The
implementation of the event queue is not important, but currently is
implemented as a <cite>skip list</cite>. That is, it is a sorted singly linked
list with skip pointers that skip over delta-time events.</p>
<p>The functor net and the threads are distinct. They communicate through
thread instructions %set, %assign, %waitfor and %load. So far as a thread
is concerned, the functor net is a blob of structure that it pokes and
prods via certain functor access instructions.</p>

<section id="vvp-compilation-and-execution">
<h2>VVP Compilation And Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#vvp-compilation-and-execution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The vvp program operates in a few steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Initialization</dt><dd><p>Data structures are cleared to empty, and tables are
readied for compilation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Compilation</dt><dd><p>The input file is read and compiled. Symbol tables are
build up as needed, objects are allocated and linked
together.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Cleanup</dt><dd><p>Symbol tables and other resources used only for
compilation are released to reduce the memory
footprint.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Simulation</dt><dd><p>Event simulation is run.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The initialization step is performed by the compile_init() function in
compile.cc. This function in turn calls all the *_init() functions in
other parts of the source that need initialization for compile. All
the various sub-init functions are called &lt;foo&gt;_init().</p>
<p>Compilation is controlled by the parser, it parse.y. As the parser
reads and parses input, the compilation proceeds in the rules by
calling various compile_* functions. All these functions live in the
compile.cc file. Compilation calls other sections of the code as
needed.</p>
<p>When the parser completes compilation, compile_cleanup() is called to
finish the compilation process. Unresolved references are completed,
then all the symbol tables and other compile-time-only resources are
released. Once compile_cleanup() returns, there is no more use for the
parser for the function in compile.cc.</p>
<p>After cleanup, the simulation is started. This is done by executing
the schedule_simulate() function. This does any final setup and starts
the simulation running and the event queue running.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-get-from-there-to-here">
<h2>How To Get From There To Here<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-from-there-to-here" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The vvp simulation engine is designed to be able to take as input a
compiled form of Verilog. That implies that there is a compiler that
compiles Verilog into a form that the vvp engine can read.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Boolean logic gates</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Gates like AND, OR and NAND are implemented simply and obviously by
functor statements. Any logic up to 4 inputs can be implemented with a
single functor. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>and gate (out, i1, i2, i3);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gate    .functor and, i1, i2, i3;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice the first parameter of the .functor is the type. The type
includes a truth table that describes the output with a given
input. If the gate is wider than four inputs, then cascade
functors. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>and gate (out, i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, i7, i8);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>gate.0  .functor and, i1, i2, i3, i4;
gate.1  .functor and, i5, i6, i7, i8;
gate    .functor and, gate.0, gate.1;
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>reg and other variables</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reg and integer are cases of what Verilog calls <cite>variables</cite>.
Variables are, simply put, things that behavioral code can assign
to. These are not the same as <cite>nets</cite>, which include wires and the
like.</p>
<p>Each bit of a variable is created by a <cite>.var</cite> statement. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>reg a;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a       .var &quot;a&quot;, 0, 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>named events</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Events in general are implemented as functors, but named events in
particular have no inputs and only the event output. The way to
generate code for these is like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a  .event &quot;name&quot;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This creates a functor and makes it into a mode-2 functor. Then the
trigger statement, “-&gt; a”, cause a <cite>%set a, 0;</cite> statement be
generated. This is sufficient to trigger the event.</p>
</section>
<section id="automatically-allocated-scopes">
<h2>Automatically Allocated Scopes<a class="headerlink" href="#automatically-allocated-scopes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a .scope statement has a &lt;type&gt; of autofunction or autotask, the
scope is flagged as being an automatically allocated scope. The functor
for each variable or event declared in that scope is added to a list
of items that need to be automatically allocated for each dynamic
instance of that scope.</p>
<p>Before copying the input parameters of an automatic function or task
into the scope variables, a new scope instance needs to be allocated.
For function or task calls in procedural code, this is handled by the
%alloc instruction. For structural function calls, this is handled
by the phantom code generated by the .ufunc statement. In both cases,
VVP attempts to use a previously freed scope instance - only if none
are available is a new instance created.</p>
<p>After copying the result of an automatic function or the output
parameters of an automatic task, the scope instance can be freed.
For function or task calls in procedural code, this is handled by the
%free instruction. For structural function calls, this is handled
by the phantom code generated by the .ufunc statement. In both cases,
VVP adds the instance to a list of freed instances for that scope,
which allows the storage to be reused the next time a new instance
is required.</p>
<p>For each automatically allocated scope instance, VVP creates an array
of items, referred to as the scope context. Each item in this array is
a pointer to the allocated storage for holding the state of one scope
variable or event. The index into this array for any given variable
or event, referred to as the context index, is stored in the functor
associated with that variable or event.</p>
<p>Each VVP thread keeps track of its current write context and current
read context. For threads executing in a static scope, these are both
initialized to null values. For threads executing in an automatically
allocated scope, these are both initialized to refer to the context
allocated to that scope.</p>
<p>Before starting the copying of the input parameters of an automatic
function or task, the current write context of the caller thread is
set to the context allocated for that function/task call. After the
thread that executed the function/task body has been rejoined and
before starting the copying of the result or output parameters, the
current write context is reset to its previous value and the current
read context is set to the context allocated for the function/task
call. After finishing the copying of the result or output parameters,
the current read context is reset to its previous value.</p>
<p>When reading or writing the state of an automatically allocated
variable or event, the associated functor indirects through the
current read or write context of the running thread, using its
stored context index.</p>
